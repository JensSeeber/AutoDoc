You can document functions via AutoDoc comments in your sources.
An AutoDoc comment always starts with #!. This is also the smallest possible
AutoDoc command. If you want your declaration documented, just write
#! at the line before the documentation. Example:

#!
DeclareOperation( "AnOperation",
                  [ IsList ] );

This will produce a manual entry for the operation AnOperation.

Before a function, you can put several AutoDoc commands, to make the manual
entry more rich. Those are:

@Description descr
which adds the next lines of AutoDoc comments without a command, until reaching the next or the declaration
to the description of the entry.

@Returns ret_val
Adds the text after this command as return value.

@Arguments args
Passes the text after this command as argument names.

@Group grpname
Adds the following method to a group with name grpname. This is only one of two ways to create groups.

@FunctionLabel label
Adds label to the function as label. By default, this is produced out of the testers.

@ChapterInfo chapter, section
Adds the entry to the given chapter in the given section.

An entry with all options can look like this

#! @Description
#! Computes the list of lists of degrees of ordinary characters
#! associated to the <A>p</A>-blocks of the group <A>G</A>
#! with <A>p</A>-modular character table <A>modtbl</A>
#! and underlying ordinary character table <A>ordtbl</A>.
#! @Returns a list
#! @Arguments modtbl
#! @Group CharacterDegreesOfBlocks
#! @FunctionLabel chardegblocks
#! @ChapterInfo Blocks, Attributes
DeclareAttribute( "CharacterDegreesOfBlocks",
        IsBrauerTable );

Also, there are commands to set some global enviroments

@Chapter name
Sets a chapter, all functions without seperate info will be added to this chapter.
Also all text comments, i.e. lines that begin with #! without a command, and which do not
follow after @description, will be added to the chapter as regular text.

@Section name
Sets a section like chapter sets a chapter.

@EndSection
Closes the current section.

@AutoDoc
Causes all functions to be documented, if they have a #! in the line before or not.

@EndAutoDoc
Causes function without #! before them to be no longer documented.

@BeginGroup [grpname]
Starts a group. All functions without @Group will now be grouped in a group, until the end group command
is triggered. Groups with the same name will be documented all together, even if there are in several documents.
Also, one can add items to the group via the @Group grpname command.

@EndGroup
Ends the current group.
